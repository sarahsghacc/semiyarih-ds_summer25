**Title**: Exploring Joyful Language in Jane Austen’s *Emma* using Tidytext


### **Instructions**


Complete the following exercises using the appropriate packages in R. Ensure that your solutions are optimized and use functional programming principles where applicable.

1.  Load the necessary libraries.
2.  Answer each question in separate R code chunks.
3.  Provide detailed explanations for your approach.
4.  Submit the rendered HTML file.








####  **Objective**:

Use the **`tidytext`** package and three different **sentiment lexicons** (`nrc`, `afinn`, `bing`) to explore **positive/joyful words** in *Emma* by Jane Austen. You will tokenize the text, apply sentiment filters, visualize frequent sentiment words using `ggplot2`, and create a word cloud.


### **Tasks**:

1. **Data Preparation** 

   * Load the `austen_books()` dataset from the **`janeaustenr`** package.
   * Group by book and detect chapter boundaries using regex.
   * Create `linenumber` and `chapter` columns.

2. **Tokenization** 

   * Use `unnest_tokens()` to tokenize text into individual words.
   * Explain briefly **why we name the output column `word`** (include this as a comment in your script).

3. **Sentiment Analysis** 

   * Filter joy/positive words from **each** of the three sentiment lexicons:

     * `nrc` (joy)
     * `afinn` (positive scores ≥ 1)
     * `bing` (positive)
   * Join each with *Emma*'s text and:

     * Count word frequency.
     * Filter for frequently occurring words (`n > 50`).
     * Visualize using a **bar chart** (`ggplot2`) and a **word cloud** (`wordcloud`).

4. **Push to GitHub** 

   * Push your complete R script (`.R` file) to a **GitHub repository**.
   * Your script should include:

     * Data wrangling
     * Sentiment filtering and joins
     * Visualization code
   * You must include **at least 5 meaningful commits** to document your workflow.
