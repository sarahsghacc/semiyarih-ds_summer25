### **Title:** Exploring Discrete and Continuous Variables with `mtcars`

### **Instructions**


Complete the following exercises using the appropriate packages in R. Ensure that your solutions are optimized and use functional programming principles where applicable.

1.  Load the necessary libraries.
2.  Answer each question in separate R code chunks.
3.  Provide detailed explanations for your approach.
4.  Submit the rendered HTML file.




### **Objective:**

Create an interactive **Shiny application** in R that allows users to explore selected **discrete and continuous variables** from the `mtcars` dataset. Your app must include multiple tabs to display:

* The data
* Summary statistics
* Boxplot (for discrete vs. continuous)
* Bar plot (for discrete variables)
* Histogram (for continuous variables)

You will **publish your app on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)** and **push your code to GitHub**. Both the **link to the published app** and the **GitHub repo** must be submitted via the Canvas assignment **text box**.

### **Technical Requirements:**

#### **1. UI Structure**

* Use `fluidPage()` layout with:

  * A red-colored title: **"Homework Assignment"**
  * Your name below the title
  * A yellow background (`setBackgroundColor("yellow")`)
  * A sidebar with two `selectInput()` dropdowns:

    * One for a **discrete** variable
    * One for a **continuous** variable
  * A main panel with `tabsetPanel()` that includes five tabs:

    * **Data**
    * **Summary**
    * **BoxPlot**
    * **Bar**
    * **Histogram**

####**2. Server Logic**

Each tab should do the following:

* **Data Tab:**

  * Show a table with the selected discrete and continuous columns from `mtcars`
  * Display the dataset name as a heading (e.g., “Dataset: mtcars”)
  
![](./pix/data)

* **Summary Tab:**

  * Display summary statistics for both selected variables
  * Organize output under clear headings: “Discrete” and “Continuous”
  
![](./pix/summary)

* **BoxPlot Tab:**

  * Show a boxplot using `ggplot2` with:

    * Discrete variable on x-axis
    * Continuous variable on y-axis

![](./pix/box)

* **Bar Tab:**

  * Show a bar plot of the frequency of the selected discrete variable
  
![](./pix/bar)

* **Histogram Tab:**

  * Show a histogram of the selected continuous variable

![](./pix/hist)

#### **3. App Behavior**

* The app should respond dynamically when users change variable selections.
* All plots must be labeled appropriately and readable.
* Code must be organized and commented.

### **Testing Your App**

Before submitting:

* Ensure all five tabs display correct outputs.
* Switch inputs multiple times to confirm app robustness.
* Use `shiny::runApp()` to test locally.
* Publish to shinyapps.io and verify the public link works.

### **Submission Instructions**

You must:

✅ Submit an `app.R` file that runs correctly.
✅ Push your project to a public **GitHub** repository with **at least one commit**.
✅ Publish your app to **shinyapps.io**.
✅ **Paste the following two links into the Canvas text submission box**:

1. GitHub repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourname/mtcars-shiny-app`)
2. Shiny app URL (e.g., `https://yourname.shinyapps.io/mtcars_app/`)
